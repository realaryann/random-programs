# random-codes
A collection of scripts written in python by an amateur developer. Currently working on "Candice" and a highschool marks database. Aiming to learn GUI making.


Candice is currently a boredom assistant capable of basic mathematical operations, number system conversions, creation of dictionaries and data storage
I am working on the source code to avoid any pre-existing bugs and it is currently written in about 150 lines. I am looking to learn about GUI so as
to make Candice an application, the current source code for Candice is present in this repository.

High School marks database is simply a database capable of-
1) Storing marks of students from classes 9 to 12
2) Adding new students into the database and entering their marks for storage
3) Looking up the marks of any student and in a particular year depending on the person.

Currently being worked upon as some bugs are present, but the source code for this is also present in the repository. 

Thanks!
